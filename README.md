# EffBee Analyser

## Compiling EffBee
Compiling and running EffBee should be relatively simple. You'll need to have both Yarn and Node JS installed. Then, `cd` to where you downloaded the repository and run `yarn install`. Then, to run the program in development mode execute `yarn dev` in the same directory. The program will run and the splash screen should display.
